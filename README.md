sourse for skills where i have learnt: all are from the autogis processes course: https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html


### Analysis steps:
I can devide this final assignment to 3 main steps:
1) Fetching data:
+ Using panda to read txt file
+ Using open street map to restreive the shortest path
+ Using request to webcraping data

2) Analyze the data
Using Open Street,  Map packages to analyze the distance and population of each health station

3) Visualization
+ Using folium to build the interactive map
+ Using mapplotlib to plot and analyze the data
